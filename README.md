# Email Spam Detector

**Email Spam Detector** is a machine learning / NLP project that detects whether an email is spam or not. The repo contains data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference code ‚Äî ready to run locally and easy to extend.

## üîç Project Overview
This project builds a classifier that labels email messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using classical ML (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest) and optionally a simple neural approach. It includes data cleaning, vectorization (TF-IDF), model training, evaluation metrics, and a prediction script for single emails or batch files.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Text cleaning and normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, optional stemming/lemmatization)
- Tokenization and TF-IDF feature extraction
- Multiple model options (Logistic Regression, SVM, RandomForest, simple neural network)
- Train / evaluate / save / load model pipeline
- CLI and script for predicting single emails or batch CSV files
- Simple web API example (Flask) for inference (optional)
- Jupyter notebooks for EDA & experiments

## üß∞ Tech stack
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- nltk / spacy (text processing) ‚Äî optional
- joblib or pickle (model serialization)
- Flask or FastAPI (optional inference API)
- jupyter (exploration)
